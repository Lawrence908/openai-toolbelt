## âœ¨ Why?

The OpenAI SDK already covers every endpoint, but real-world apps need:

* Centralized config (model defaults, organization IDs, etc.)
* Automatic retries & exponential back-off
* Cost and token accounting
* Transparent request/response logging
* Easy caching for deterministic prompts
* Opinionated helpers for common patterns (chat, embeddings, audio, images, file upload)
* Async *and* sync flavours with identical APIs

`openai-toolbelt` gives you those features in one import, so you can focus on building.
